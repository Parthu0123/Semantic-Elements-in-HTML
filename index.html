                <h1>Iron_man</h1>
                <p>Major Iron Man stories include "Demon in a Bottle" (1979), "Armor Wars" (1987-1988), "Extremis" (2005), and "Iron Man
                2020" (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories Civil War (2006-2007), Dark Reign (2008-2009),
                and Civil War II (2016). Additional superhero characters have emerged from Iron Man's supporting cast, including James
                Rhodes as War Machine and Riri Williams as Ironheart, as well as reformed villains, Natasha Romanova as Black Widow and
                Clint Barton as Hawkeye. Iron Man's list of enemies includes his archenemy, the Mandarin, various supervillains of
                communist origin, and many of Stark's business rivals.
            Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense. Marvel premiered
            several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and
            horror comics. Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in
            December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date. Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel
            changed it to gold because of issues with printing. Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at
            Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he
            could write the stories himself.
        Heck continued as the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel properties. As part of a shuffling to match artists with the characters they were most suited for, Steve Ditko briefly became the
        artist for Iron Man. He was responsible for only three issues in late 1963, but in this time he redesigned Iron
        Man's suit from fully gold to the red and gold color scheme that became the character's primary image. Iron Man's
        recurring nemesis, the Mandarin, first appeared shortly after in Tales of Suspense #50 (1964). By this time, the
        science-fiction and horror stories were phased out from Tales of Suspense, and the series ran only Iron Man and Captain
        America stories. Gene Colan became the artist for Iron Man in January 1966, bringing with him an expressionist
        style.</p>
